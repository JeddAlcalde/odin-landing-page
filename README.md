Initial:
Project is to create a webpage that looks similar to one we are provided by The Odin Project. 2 Images are given to us by The Odin Project, and the font being Roboto. Suggestions are that I take the 4 sections one at a time.

Currently I know how to use CSS and HTML together, and the basic concepts of the flexbox but this is the first time I'm using it in a project.

Finished:
Project was very fun and although given guidelines, I enjoyed every step and I mean it. Definetly gave me a lot of time to really figure out how different display values work and flexbox being really helpful many times. I also gained a much better understanding of alignment of items in divs.
